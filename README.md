## Tools used
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Firebase database

## Project Status
- This project is complete.
- Due to COVID-19 further development of this project came to an end. Future developments of this project would have included the use of the Angular framework.

## Reflection
This project was intended to be a deep dive into web development using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
### Challenges
- Developing the web application under a short deadline was challenging within itsself.
- Understadning promises and understanding how to connect to Firebase database was challenge.
- Implementing security throughout the application was a challenge. Without proper knowledge of how to secure the student's data throughout their use of the application, I had to figure out an alternative way for them to use the application. By using their student ID numbers and their preferred name, students were able to access their Colonial Carnival account and gain points as they play.
- Understanding how to use Firebase database.
